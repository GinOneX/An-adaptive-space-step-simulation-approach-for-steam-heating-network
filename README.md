# An-adaptive-space-step-simulation-approach-for-steam-heating-network
#This code develops a novel adaptive space-step simulation approach for steam heating network considering the condensate loss. The model equations are obtained through derivation from the primitive differential equations based on the trapezoidal formula. Meanwhile, a quasi-linear fitting method is proposed to simplify the calculation of steam enthalpy. To solve the model, the computation process is decoupled as hydraulic calculation and thermal calculation, and the converge is achieved through alternating iterative algorithm. A condensate check is introduced after the thermal calculation, in which the condensate loss can be calculated. To acquire the expected simulation precision, a space-step adaption method is developed, where nodes are automatically added to increase accuracy.
